## What is the Pretius x-y of Lazy z Pagination Plugin

The "Pretius x-y of Lazy z Pagination" plugin is designed to optimize Oracle APEX Interactive Reports (IR) when dealing with large datasets. If you have an IR on a massive table and experience slow performance due to pagination (the **X-Y of Z** row count display), this plugin addresses that problem by calculating and displaying the **Z** (total row count) lazily, after the report refreshes.

## Release History

24.1.1
- Initial version

## Installation

1. Download the plugin from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Pretius/pretius-x-y-of-lazy-z).
2. Import the plugin into your APEX application via the Shared Components section.

## Usage

To use the plugin in your Interactive Report:

![Preview image](assets/usage.png)

1. Set up an IR on a large dataset.
2. Ensure Pagintation is set to **Row Ranges X to Y** (default)
3. Add the plugin to the **After Refresh** event of the Interactive Report.
4. In **Affected Elements**, use the **Triggering Element** as the **Selection Type**
5. Ensure **Fire on Initialization** is enabled


This approach ensures that the total row count (**Z**) is loaded asynchronously, improving the overall performance of your Interactive Report.

## Settings

Use Cache
  - Enabled (Default) : Caches the rowcount after fetching. Refetches & caches if filters change
    - Pros: Silky smooth experience for the user
    - Cons: Rowcounts may become stale
  - Disabled : Fetches fresh rowcounts after each pagination or filter change
    - Pros: Rowcounts correct after each fetch
    - Cons: More spinners/waiting for the users
